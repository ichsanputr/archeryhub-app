                    <h2 id="dashboard-access">Access Event History</h2>
                    <p>All events that you have registered for can be seen via <strong>Dashboard > My Events</strong>. This page summarizes all your competition activities, both those that are just taking place and those that have already been completed.</p>

                    <h2 id="meaning-status">Understanding Registration Status</h2>
                    <p>There are several status stages that you need to pay attention to:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Pending:</strong> Registration has been recorded, but payment has not been made or has not been confirmed.</li>
                        <li><strong>Paid:</strong> Payment has been received by the archeris.net system.</li>
                        <li><strong>Verified:</strong> Your participation data has been checked and approved by the organizing committee.</li>
                        <li><strong>Rejected:</strong> Registration rejected (usually due to category mismatch or invalid data).</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2 id="manage-invoice">Manage Invoices</h2>
                    <p>If you need to see detailed cost details or change your payment method (as long as it has not expired), you can click on the invoice number listed on your registration list.</p>

                    <h2 id="download-ticket">Download Ticket & QR Code</h2>
                    <p>After your status becomes <strong>Verified</strong>, the button to download the E-Ticket will be active. This ticket contains a unique QR Code that you must show when checking in at the match location for the attendance process and equipment verification.</p>
