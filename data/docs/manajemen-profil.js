                    <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
                    <p>The settings page on archeris.net is the control center for your digital identity.

                    <h2 id="managing-data">Managing Personal Data</h2>
                    <p>Each account type has a different information focus during the profile update process:</p>

                        <li><strong>Archer:</strong> Complete athlete data such as full name, primary bow type, home club, and a short bio to build your portfolio of achievements.</li>
                        <li><strong>Organization:</strong> Update the organization's official identity, vision and mission, brief history, and FAQ information so that potential event participants get clear information.</li>

                    </ul>

                    <h2 id="account-security">Security & Password</h2>

                    <h2 id="change-email">Change Email Address</h2>
                    <p>For security reasons, email address changes require additional verification steps:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Enter your new email address in the form provided.</li>
                        <li>The system will send a verification code (OTP) to the new email.</li>
                        <li>Enter the code you received to confirm that the email is yours.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>After verification, your login email address will automatically change to a new address.</p>

                    <h2 id="theme-settings">Theme & Appearance</h2>
                    <p>Each user has different display tastes. In the user settings section, you can choose between <strong>Light Mode</strong> or <strong>Dark Mode</strong> for your dashboard. Choose what is most comfortable for your eyes when managing archery data for a long time.</p>
